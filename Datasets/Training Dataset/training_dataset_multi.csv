"Mumbai anyways is a city where people are rude and want to fight with each other. Although it is a blanket generalization, most people you talk to in Mumbai will be rude because rudeness is as infectious as a smile! Jio embodies this to the core. If you work in Jio, you will be fighting with your colleagues on a daily basis. You will get directions from various people. Although nobody writes their designation in the â  signature or even in the Employee portal. But people try to delegate work to anyone who they think may be younger or junior or less dynamic than them! Nobody likes to work here. If you are in a senior level, you will make 1 strategy everyday! And it will get trashed the next week. None of the documents are shared by people to other teams except the few confidants of Shri MDA (as they call Mukesh Ambani here). These guys are Shri MM, Shri PP, Shri JT, Shri KT, Shri Anish Bhai etc. Apart from these few even the CEO is a puppet. People do not share any documents with other teams. Different teams do not collaborate with each other and create their own plans. The situation is extremely chaotic here.
In terms of infrastructure everything is good, except that the car parks are not in the building but a little away. Walk to the building takes 10-15 minutes. The lifts are not well configures and people have to wait long for them.
Although you are actually doing nothing, they keep making you do something which gets trashed in the next few days. Its just a technique to keep you busy.

keep going U are awesome but pay well for employees also instead of showering offers to public.,2
"work culture,job security to a certain limit.,growth option since its a new set up.",2
good salary structure for marketing freshers to start their carrier,2
Some of the internal processes takes too much time and in the end the customer is affected by this.,-1
"Like most big companies, I assume, it can often take a while to get things done and/ or approved, especially from Senior Management",-1
Need to get mature as IT industry,-1
Internal Processes makes it difficult to perform your role to the fullest,-1
There is Old school Management style. no one dont help you from other departments. So you should always push somebody to do your work.,-2
less salary offered for freshers,-1
I take to time to understand the process of work.. after that there is no challenge for me.,1
"too much bureaucracy
too many procedures
crowdy working space
no carrer path / development / limited opportunities",-2
No money for onsite people. Only money given to spend there. Very much like another domestick company. Not like a MNC. No IT culture. Very primitive type of worl mainly L1 support projects.,-1
"Some managers. Some processes. Flogging continues until morale improves. Restructures cycle 18 months. No rem increase for three years. No car parking.
Different leaders steering the boat with no clear direction.
Not always using the technology available.",-1
The clarity and alignment between the overarching corporate aims/values and individual goals could be better,-1
Workload is high due to lots of deadlines. The company is constantly reorganising which distract from the actual work.,-1
"Well,here in Romania you have to dedicate more time for you to have great achievments,like great salary compensations ,but the most difficult part is time,you have to dedicade a lot from you personal time in this branche!",-1
Cultural mix makes development difficult.,-1
the exposure to my field was limited.,-1
Complex and limitation of the career development,-2
Saturation of Telcom Market affect on company revenue which consequently affect employees benefits,-1
Growing pains in new markets in terms of products and integration of business,-1
Work/life balance is really bad..salary isnt that good,-2
"Group governance can be complex to understand, very difficult to implement and sometimes impossible to influence. OpCos are sandwiched between tight business goals and decentralised decision making.",-1
"Lack of strategy, both in terms of leadership and technology. Communication from upper management flip-flops between one strategic direction to a complete 180 degree turn in short timeframes (i.e. 3 months). Vodafone NZ has had the meat cut from it and all that remains is the skeleton. Management are only concerned with their own positions. There is very poor career growth and opportunities to progress. Bonus â€¦Â  schemes are vague and numbers seem to appear without rationale. I had 3 different managers in a period of 6 months. Upper level management don't even seem to know what they're selling. Contractors seem to be preferred over full time employees. If you apply for a job you probably wont be notified if you're unsuccessful. Your application will disappear into a deep dark black hole. Negotiate a maximum rem package you can and prepare to stay for a short term. The local competition have been thrashing it and there is negative growth in the telco market.Show More",-2
Too much of the same projects. Salary too low. Chance too grow your career within company is very weak. Education is not as important as professional experience.,-1
"Large company that can take some time in taking on some of the wonderful new products it's developing.

Office politics won't be missed one bit!",2
"Slow, hierarchical, overly political and without a clear vision.",-2
"The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. Fragmented work force, simply just a mess on that front.
Also management heavy, with everything tied up in red tape and paper work.",-2
"Horrible working houres ,you will end up working more than 12hr.",-2

Travel time and career growth are limited,1
Nothing against vodafone as it is amazing!,2
"A disaster, no common sense and no culture that drives the company further.
All managers think about how to save their positions, be more powerful (even if not more useful or productive) and not be blamed about the constant problems that come up, i.e. always making sure there is someone else to blame. Oh and meet the objectives, at any cost: even the company's interests' cost.
Ambitious and proactive employees â€¦Â  are seen as a threat and therefore put in a corner. There is no team spirit whatsoever with the exception of some small peer collaboration that is often overwhelmed by managers.
Everyone seems to be looking for a new job and I believe that the main reason why the majority hasn't left yet is that Vodafone pays well enough, so other companies have a hard time matching salaries.
HR is a ghost: all HR related issues are to be resolved with your Line Manager, who normally is the cause of those problems - so very helpful!! the only HR contact employees have is an HR call centre. Awful.

Changes in the business are rarely discussed by managers, senior or middle, and are mostly discussed around the smoking shelter where the message is rarely complete or correct.

Their complaints department are nonexistent! You think I exaggerate. I'm not kidding. My approach is to be as nice to customers as possible, provide complete and accurate information in a timely fashion. Unfortunately the rest of the business are targeted in such a way that they're unable to provide such levels of service with the poor level of training they receive (south Africa / Egypt care estates). And good luck trying to get a resolution to customer issues, managers don't want to take escalations or provide support on the phone with particularly difficult customers.

"Where to start. Having worked with the company for a few years I can honestly say what they portray to the outside world and what is said internally are miles apart. Vodafone likes to see itself as the network to beat, the most expensive sure, but the best. This is a flat out lie. As staff we are having to content with ever increasing sales targets in an increasingly competitive market. To help in the competitive â€¦Â  market you would expect to be given the tools from upper management to do your job, you are not. Vodafone's upper management looks at a piece of paper that shows sales on it, they do no care about anything else, they will not listen to what you have to say, they do not care. When other networks and stores such as Carphone and Phones4U are beating your prices by over Â£10 a month they don't care. There is so much pressure put on staff to perform that it forces staff to go blur the line between right and wrong. To sell products to customers that aren't fit for them, products that will cost much more. In public Vodafone will deny this of course, they have a good PR team, but that doesn't stop it happening. behind closed doors staff are threatened with a disciplinary if they don't sell a certain number of products, regardless of whether customers want it or not. I can tell you now, if Vodafone were to be 100% honest with customers they wouldn't have any left. The amount of facts that staff are forced to omit just to be able to get through a month without being action planned is horrifying. This is all just before the sale. After the sale is just as bad. Customers, after a recent purchase are sent a survey asking for feedback, the first question, would you recommend vodafone? This is the question that advisors are rated on. Not the following 2 questions: ""How was your visit to store today"" and ""how would you rate your advisor"". They don't care at all about them 2 questions, they may as well not be sent. ""Would you recommend Vodafone"". So if a customer has had a problem with vodafone in the past, a problem that may well have been sorted by the member of staff in store they may give a 6, 7 or 8 out of ten, if you are thinking ""well thats not bad, 8/10 is pretty good"" wrong again, Vodafone don't care about 8/10, even if the comment with it is as follows: ""The advisor in store is incredible, they are the only reason that I have decided to stay with vodafone, however, I get poor signal at work, so lost 2 marks."" Then expect to be given a lecture about how poor your service is, because it is of course your fault, not the companies poor network that's the problem (see the multiple recent articles about vodafones network). Next you have to compete with customer services (CS), fighting a constant fight on behalf of your customers to get CS to correct a wrong, surely you just ask a fellow vodafone colleague to amend the system and its done? Wrong. vodafone already have you tied into a 24 month contract, why else are CS stationed where they are cheapest to run? So after you have overcame the language barrier, and finally got the CS agent to agree with you, vodafone throw another wall in your way, policies, Vodafone's policies do nothing but make your job harder, they constantly stop you from being able to come to a favourable resolution and providing a good outcome to the customer. So after all this, you are the bad guy, the customer is venting at you, for a fault not of your own, that you are unable to solve because of archaic policies put in place by higher management that have lost touch with reality let alone their customers.

Definitely visit these offices in interview stage to get an idea of whether this journey is going to be bearable for you.
There's a lack of team spirit within my own department, I'm sure this is due to the multiple site locations, hot desking and also individuals working from home i.e. you could potentially not see a close team member for a whole week even though you're both working full time.

"There is always a challenge to achieve the work/life balance as the targets for sales people are quite stretching and challenging. And the only way to achieve this is either be a great time manager or be prepared to put in the odd evening or weekend to keep your head above the water line.

Commercials on some deals will test your sales skills to sell the USP's offered rather than sell on price.Show More",-1

HR practises belong in the stone age. Middle management generally intellectually compromised. Feeling the pains of trying to mature in an immature sector. Layers are often disconnected with each other.,-1
