Although it is a blanket generalization, most people you talk to in Mumbai will be rude because rudeness is as infectious as a smile! Jio embodies this to the core. If you work in Jio, you will be fighting with your colleagues on a daily basis. You will get directions from various people. Although nobody writes their designation in the â  signature or even in the Employee portal. But people try to delegate work to anyone who they think may be younger or junior or less dynamic than them! Nobody likes to work here. If you are in a senior level, you will make 1 strategy everyday! And it will get trashed the next week. None of the documents are shared by people to other teams except the few confidants of Shri MDA (as they call Mukesh Ambani here). These guys are Shri MM, Shri PP, Shri JT, Shri KT, Shri Anish Bhai etc. Apart from these few even the CEO is a puppet. People do not share any documents with other teams. Different teams do not collaborate with each other and create their own plans. The situation is extremely chaotic here.
In terms of infrastructure everything is good, except that the car parks are not in the building but a little away. Walk to the building takes 10-15 minutes. The lifts are not well configures and people have to wait long for them.
Although you are actually doing nothing, they keep making you do something which gets trashed in the next few days. Its just a technique to keep you busy.

"2344",2642,"Where to start. Having worked with the company for a few years I can honestly say what they portray to the outside world and what is said internally are miles apart. Vodafone likes to see itself as the network to beat, the most expensive sure, but the best. This is a flat out lie. As staff we are having to content with ever increasing sales targets in an increasingly competitive market. To help in the competitive â€¦Â  market you would expect to be given the tools from upper management to do your job, you are not. Vodafone's upper management looks at a piece of paper that shows sales on it, they do no care about anything else, they will not listen to what you have to say, they do not care. When other networks and stores such as Carphone and Phones4U are beating your prices by over Â£10 a month they don't care. There is so much pressure put on staff to perform that it forces staff to go blur the line between right and wrong. To sell products to customers that aren't fit for them, products that will cost much more. In public Vodafone will deny this of course, they have a good PR team, but that doesn't stop it happening. behind closed doors staff are threatened with a disciplinary if they don't sell a certain number of products, regardless of whether customers want it or not. I can tell you now, if Vodafone were to be 100% honest with customers they wouldn't have any left. The amount of facts that staff are forced to omit just to be able to get through a month without being action planned is horrifying. This is all just before the sale. After the sale is just as bad. Customers, after a recent purchase are sent a survey asking for feedback, the first question, would you recommend vodafone? This is the question that advisors are rated on. Not the following 2 questions: ""How was your visit to store today"" and ""how would you rate your advisor"". They don't care at all about them 2 questions, they may as well not be sent. ""Would you recommend Vodafone"". So if a customer has had a problem with vodafone in the past, a problem that may well have been sorted by the member of staff in store they may give a 6, 7 or 8 out of ten, if you are thinking ""well thats not bad, 8/10 is pretty good"" wrong again, Vodafone don't care about 8/10, even if the comment with it is as follows: ""The advisor in store is incredible, they are the only reason that I have decided to stay with vodafone, however, I get poor signal at work, so lost 2 marks."" Then expect to be given a lecture about how poor your service is, because it is of course your fault, not the companies poor network that's the problem (see the multiple recent articles about vodafones network). Next you have to compete with customer services (CS), fighting a constant fight on behalf of your customers to get CS to correct a wrong, surely you just ask a fellow vodafone colleague to amend the system and its done? Wrong. vodafone already have you tied into a 24 month contract, why else are CS stationed where they are cheapest to run? So after you have overcame the language barrier, and finally got the CS agent to agree with you, vodafone throw another wall in your way, policies, Vodafone's policies do nothing but make your job harder, they constantly stop you from being able to come to a favourable resolution and providing a good outcome to the customer. So after all this, you are the bad guy, the customer is venting at you, for a fault not of your own, that you are unable to solve because of archaic policies put in place by higher management that have lost touch with reality let alone their customers.

The Paddington office is always crammed on a Monday or any days where there are departmental meetings going on and you aren't always guaranteed a desk to sit at due to the 'hot desk' set up here.
The Newbury office is in the middle of nowhere and if you have to use public transport the whole way, you have to time your underground train, overground train and Newbury bus perfectly for the journey to be bearable. Obviously being the HQ, I'd say don't work at Vodafone (even in a London based role, as you will have to travel more than they disclose at interview stage) if you can't get to Newbury easily. Definitely visit these offices in interview stage to get an idea of whether this journey is going to be bearable for you.
There's a lack of team spirit within my own department, I'm sure this is due to the multiple site locations, hot desking and also individuals working from home i.e. you could potentially not see a close team member for a whole week even though you're both working full time.
