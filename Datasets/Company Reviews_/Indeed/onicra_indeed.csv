Worst company. Lack focus and direction. Lacks vision for business. Promoters are shallow and lack the basic sense of running a business. Don't have reserves to even pay employee salaries.
I got a good exposure working with Onicra.Proper work life balance.It's a good company to start your career.I was a contractual employee but still got good benefits.
The work culture is not at all good and lots of work pressure. The management is also not co operative

"The typical day for me was to stretch till 2:30 am from 9:30 am, there used to be long working hours to meet close the cases. 
I learned Verification process, making final reports and doing QC on the reports.
The new management was not so motivating for the employees, as people used to stretch for the company but management never give credit to the employees which resulted in immense frustration among the employees. Though the higher management recognised it after six months and changed the entire new management.  
The workplace culture is satisfactory there, as a fresher can learn many things and no one rushes to other.
The hardest past of the job was stretching the shift by 5-6 hours most often. 
The enjoyable part of the job was to  observe all festivals."

"Onicra is a performance oriented company. We have extremely strict SLA adherence with clients, thus work pressure is immense. At times due to the nature of the industry, it can get difficult, but compared to 2 years ago the work load has dropped significantly due to automation.

The company under its new leadership is focussing primarily on automation, SLA delivery and maintaining the highest quality standards for its clients."

"HR is not aware of the HR policies.
HR and the senior management is ruthless.
Management is not aware of the process.
No job security.
Wiki leaks is HR department.
No training provided as trainer is not aware of the process.
Operations team don't know what and why they are doing the job.
The only motive is to focus on numbers.
Only one way to survive and get promoted is foot licking.

It was good exp to work there. Nice and best place to work I left this organisation due to personal problem either I will not leave that organisation.
One of my best organisation ever because i learned a lot from this organisation specially from my boss and colleagues. Really Onicra gave me lot of opportunities to grow and excel.

The disappointments can be anything, from an employee who left for personal reasons or the project that you did not bag because of the financials involved.however once i got stuck and have committed to customer to Activate the connection within 24 hrs but due to some Technical issue fail do achieve my TAT.

In customer services every day we use to learn new thing as we use to handle new customer with existing one, however i have groom my communication skill,presentation skill,handle different types of customers and all this experience help me lot to handle my customer in difficult situation and make them delight.  

Working in an atmosphere where I am continuously learning new things and improve my skills.Work environments where trust and team work are keys to success. I really enjoy working with teams and feel mutual trust and respect which is a necessary component to any job. 

I 'am very much comfortable with my co-worker because there are very supportive and having good command on the process and there are very much concern about there given task,and we always work like a team.

When it's time for cross cutting in a company and i got the responsibility to download the same to my juniors its was painful and hard time in the company.

 
When someone from my team use to achieved or get promoted is my enjoyable movement of my job"

"During my days in Onicra,I was given the responsibility of corporate sales.I worked in the BFSI vertical which mainly diligence & verification type of services.My job was to pay visits to the senior level managers in various banks & nbfc's & convince them to go for an agreement,this was the part which i enjoyed the most.I learnt things like corporate communications,team management etc.The environment in my office was such that apart from sales one needs to concentrate on operations too.My team mates were cooperative with me.The overall management of the company was not quite good as the salary disbursement was never on time & confusion prevailed every now & then."
"In last 6 years of experience I have learned if you want do anything you do it, no limit in the sky.
And I take the responsibility of job and fulfill the all objectives of the organization.
And work with the fun & enjoyment build the team, learn from the senior and deliver to the massage our team members. 

Thanks"
"As a fresher Onicra is a good place.
There is balanced work-life.
Office employees are friendly always available for help.
Poor management.
Low salary .There you will not satisfied  with your appraisal.

Good exposure as had a huge role to handle at PAN INDIA level but nevertheless being in the Telecom sector is quite a roller coaster.
it was my good experience and learn core management and operations tips which were always important for me.I do enjoy when i was busy with my works and manage my team whether it was operation and field force.
"I feel good of being a par of very crucial team and handling cases of major clients of the organization.

My typical day at work was when I was very new to the organization and one of my team member was on leave for 2 days, so I have double responsibility of work and have stretched for 4 hrs late a night.

Co-workers are good, few of them are friends for life time.

Hardest part of the job is to meet the daily targets of closing employment checks when response for the same is totally depends on HR of different organisations."

in my Opinion Onicra provides better career path in BGC Department . One can learn a lot from here or also good for freshers who wants to start his career.
"Everyday i start my day from the new acquisition of clients via bank managers by meeting regularly , and following up with the data provided and finding clients , and also pushing channel partners for more data of clients and educate them for understanding benefits of service , and looking for the opportunity to close the call in one sitting.

i learned whats the customer and the banker relation ship and to avoid unwanted discrepancy among various industries , and there problems with government and how to overcome the odds etc.

hardest part of job is to maintain myself very polite when any channel partner goes on asking for payment when not received by management .

enjoyable part of job is to maintain relationship and that is quite interesting as per me."
