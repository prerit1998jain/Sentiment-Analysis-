The management hierarchy is open for everyone to interact on different levels and while you report to a specific manager you will be able to go on the floor and interact with other teams and other managers.

Which leaves you looking like a zombie at work and productivity marginally goes out the window. Repeat this over a course of time, you end up with a hay wired biological clock that has no set sleep timings or food timings.
