* I learned many a lessions during this  journey in the Bank.In nut shell I learned that good behaviour, wise adminstration, resorting to  transparency and positive attitude in solving problems always helped me in getting good results.
* I did not have much problem with the Management as such.They were demanding in getting results,which I tried to deliver all along.
* I had the opportunity to intereact and work together with  thousands of co workers during more than 3 decades of worklife.It is true that capability differed from man to man,but I tried to make them deliver the best in them.
* Every action in Bank is related with money.Hence it had to be ensured that mistakes committed by me or my colleages were kept to bare minimum, lest Bank's interest remains protected.Be it payment of a fraudent cheque or in the area of quality of  advances made.

Inspite of all the hardships, it is the best place to learn banking as knowledge transfer among colleagues is absolutely no issue and you get exposed to different facets of banking and customer handling.

It's sad to say that Management shows absolutely no signs of adopting modern management techniques which leads to demotivation and disenchantment among the mid and lower level workers.Also, the marked demarcation between the clerical staff and the officers make accountability and staff management for a branch manager very difficult.

I have been lucky to have come across wonderful coworkers most of the time.

The hardest part of the job is the transfer policy which is due to the vast network of the branches.

You have to reach the office atleast 30 minutes before the opening time and cannot leave till the work is finished and so mostly we stay back upto late hours. The management is good.The Bank sees welfare of its employees. Employees get good salary and other benefits like fully furnished residence, Conveyance allowance, Leave Travel Facility, Leave encasement facility,unlimited medical facility, Entertainment allowance, Loans at concessional rates for Construction/ purchase of house and flats, Children Education Loans, Vehicle Loan, Loans for Furniture/ fixture etc. Children also get scholarship and part of fees in the School and Colleges. Thus it look after everything like our parents. The co-workers are very cooperative and share working knowledge and work also. The hardest part of the job is to manage the work when so many co-workers or absent and you have to manage the job without any replacement. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we see satisfaction in our customer's face.","24","https://www.indeed.co.in/cmp/State-Bank-of-India/reviews?start=460"

The experience and exposure that you gain is varied and wide. It is a great place to work having the widest range of customers possible and allows flexibility of working in multiple divisions at the same time.
The only thing that holds the institution back is the misfit of values, time and attitudes of employees. The new technology and innovations, though state-of-the-art is not appreciated or fully understood by its older employees ?(85%)
Co-workers are mostly intelligent and well -informed, though reluctant to share their expertise.
