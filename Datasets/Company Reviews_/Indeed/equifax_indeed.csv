At this job I learned the importance of patience, learning to not match the behavior and attitudes of the consumers, and how to document detailed notes on accounts.

The hardest part of working for Equifax was the lack of peer and managment interaction. Most of the day was spent on the phone and little time was dedicated to buidling peer relationships and interacting and getting to know management.

There is a lot of favoritism here, hints the people that recieve incentives every month are the same people, with one or two lucky new people to recieve it every few months. They are able to keep their incentives every month and their high production scores because they are trained in other areas that most of the department isn't. There are temps that have been here for 5+ years, but those are the favorites. There is only a handful of full-time workers here so if you're looking for a permanent position, chances are slim. I've seen a lot of new faces in the past year of working here. The turnover rate is horrible. People have been dying off from Equifax like the plague. The job gets boring. The leads are on youtube when form volumes are high or too busy trying to watch the employee's every move, when they should be helping the processors if they don't have anything else to do. If there's a question or issue, they want you to speak to your team lead first, but the team leads don't respond to emails and the assistant manager doesn't care. During the holidays you'll be bumped down to part-time hours because the volume is low. Be prepared to get sent home early A LOT. The temp agency tells you to be available for an 8 hr shift BETWEEN Xam-Xpm, but I guess Equifax thinks you are supposed to work a 13 hour shift if volume is high. If you have a child/children, make sure you have someone who can watch your child/children 24 hours","20","https://www.indeed.co.in/cmp/Equifax/reviews?fcountry=ALL&start=380"

There was plenty of support from your coworkers, team leads, and management, and the work was challenging. However, there was a lot of pressure from the sales force to deliver data using systems and models that were not ready for production based on promises made to clients that were wholly unrealistic. If the data returned was erroneous because the models had not been properly validated by another department that was unwilling to communicate with the outside, the FA could and would be held at fault. Fortunately, this was not a common occurrence, as QC and QA procedures were very tight across the whole organization. Institutional inertia could be challenging because there was pressure to migrate programs to newer platforms while maintaining timetables. Often because of the effort required to migrate, the sentiment was to not fix was wasn't broken, but migration was a component of job responsibility.

Overall, it was a good company to work for. They looked after the employees and you had to make serious and repeated errors to be released. However, they are continuing to embrace newer, more automated technologies that will allow higher volumes with fewer workers, so job security is not great.","10","https://www.indeed.co.in/cmp/Equifax/reviews?fcountry=ALL&start=180"
